# Map channel names to queue names
# When a message is received on a channel (key), it will be pushed to the corresponding queue(s) (value)
# 
# Supports two formats:
# 1. Single queue (backward compatible):
#    channel-name: queue-name
# 
# 2. Multiple queues (one-to-many):
#    channel-name:
#      - queue-name-1
#      - queue-name-2
#
mappings:
  # Single queue mapping
  notifications: notifications-queue
  logs: logs-queue
  
  # Multiple queue mapping (fan-out pattern)
  events:
    - events-queue
    - audit-queue
